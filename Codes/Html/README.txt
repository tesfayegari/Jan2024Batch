HTML Tags/Html elements are name labels within less than and greater than signs example <h1>, <a> 
Most html elements comes as a pair which we call it start tag and end tag. End tag is similar to start tag with </h1>

Example Tesfaye's tag comes as a pair like below 
<tesfaye></tesfaye>  <h1></h1>

Each element which comes as a pair may have child tags in it. Example. The following div tag has h1 tag as a child. and h1 tag has a text as a child 

<div> <h1>I am heading ....</h1> </div>

Each element can have one or more attribute. Attributes are property value pain in a start tag 

example in  <html lang="en"> </html> lang is an attribute with value = en=us
